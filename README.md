# BEW---Barrier-Experience-for-the-Web

The Goal of the present Bachelor thesis was to create a concept and develop as software
tool. The use of the software tool is, to create experienceable barriers for the usersâ€™
interaction with websites. The barriers should help to give the user a feeling for the
existence of barriers in the web and provide information for helping to create an
accessible web.

At First before starting with the development of the software, the thesis explains the
relevance of accessibility for todays and futures user of the web. Afterwards the
architecture for a Google Chrome Browser-Extension will be developed. The main goal in
creating the Extension lies to expandability, accessibility and flexibility and is developed
with common web technologies like JavaScript, html, css and json.

Following the thesis will provide three different experienceable barriers for websites.
During development of the barriers a hybrid technique between quantitative and
qualitative exploration was used.

The result of the bachelor thesis is a fully functional Google Chrome Browser-Extension
which can be used on any website to evoke three different experienceable barriers.

The author hopes to help with the developed browser-extension to increase the
awareness for barriers and accessibility on the web.
